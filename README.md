## Example

What makes this different from deploying a normal remix app to Vercel,
is that Vercel doesn't include files from the root `node_modules` when deploying the app.
In order to work around this, we take the server build output from `remix` and
bundle it using `rollup` so that all the necessary dependencies are present when deployed.

Another important thing to note is that the `ui` package needs to be built.
Many turborepo examples don't build the `ui` package, but if we don't, remix is not able to use it.

In order for this to work, your Vercel config should look like this:
